## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# import libraries
library(car)
library(lmtest)
library(dplyr) # dataframe
library(ggplot2)
library(gmodels) # Crosstable
library(class) # knn
library(neuralnet) # ANN
library(kernlab) #SVM
library(C50) # decision tree

# read data file
housing <- read.csv("california-housing-prices.csv")
str(housing)

housing_train <- housing[1:16000,]
housing_test <- housing[16001:20640,]

```

```{r}
#clean data

housing$total_bedrooms <- ifelse(is.na(housing$total_bedrooms), mean(housing$total_bedrooms, na.rm = TRUE)/mean(housing$total_rooms, na.rm = TRUE)*housing$total_rooms, housing$total_bedrooms)

```

## linear regression

```{r}
model_lin <- lm(median_house_value ~., data = housing)
summary(model_lin)
```
